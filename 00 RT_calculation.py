This is a program which calculates the reflection and transmission coefficients.
considering the situation of Cyro-UT, there are only 2 interfaces:
1. a fluid-solid interface (Oblique incidence)
2. a solid-solid Interface

density : $rho$
wave speed : $c$

incident wave:
reflected wave:
transmitted wave:

transmission coefficient:
reflection coefficient:

transmission coefficient of Ligitudinal wave
transmission coefficient of transversal wave

reflection coefficient of Ligitudinal wave
reflection coefficient of transversal wave
